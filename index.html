            <h3>Why Dalí?</h3>
            <p>
              Salvador Dalí , was known for his wild art and a public
              personality to match, and these two elements helped him rise above
              the rest of the surrealists. His quote said it all “the difference
              between me and the surrealists, is that I am a surrealist”.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is memorable because he was a pioneer of the movement. He was
              involved in all aspects of artistic creation from painting,
              sculpture, design, drawing, movies, fashion, etc. He applied the
              surrealist concept to everything he said and did. His audacity and
              rebellious attitude towards art and politics set him aside from
              others and allowed him to create some of the most famous and
              recognizable paintings of the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only did he leave a mark on surrealism but even twenty years
              following his death, his artwork and influences can be seen almost
              everywhere around the world. If you stop anyone in the street,
              most will be familiar with at least one of his images. The name
              Dalí is magic, he remains an icon.

                  Dali himself refurbished this burnt down theater to become his
                  main museum. A place that feels like a fun fair, that Dali
                  considered the largest surrealist creation in the world. This
                  is the place to come to see Dali artwork in Spain.

                  This Paris museum is based on a private collection. Mr
                  Beniamino Levi was an art dealer, museum curator and personal
                  friend of Dali. The collection of Dali Paris consists mainly
                  of bronze sculptures and watercolors. The influence of
                  literature (Quichotte, Alice in Wonderland), mythology and the
                  bible is patent in the artwork displayed.

              Hi! My name is Zgene'. I did this project about Salvador Dali
              because I love his work, it's truly something else. Thanks to my
              mother, I have been around his artwork since I was little. I have
              quite a few prints and a couple originals currenly hanging in my
              home.
